          Whitney, my love, You are in the wilderness in the middle of the
          night, alone. It is winter, and you’ve never seen so much undisturbed
          snow in your life. Not a branch, a paw, or foot has touched this part
          of the world it seems. The loneliness in the air is a kind you’ve
          never met before. You know how you can be sitting in an air
          conditioned room, and suddenly the air shuts off and you realize for
          the first time that it had made any noise at all? This is kind of like
          that, but instead of the sound of air, it’s the residue of life you
          are missing. Never had you been aware of the energy left behind to a
          place where there had been laughter, until you were in a place where
          there had never been any laughter at all. You don’t know why you’re
          here, when you came to be here, or even where here is, but you know
          you need to leave.
        </p>
