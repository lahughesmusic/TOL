          He looks at you but only for a moment, then he quickly goes back to
          pawing the ornament. ‘clink’ ‘clink’ ‘clink’ it goes. He seems focused
          and determined. You ask him, why are you making so much noise? To
          which he replies “I am lost. I have lost my human and I have lost my

          memory, but it seems to be the only one I kept. Why is it not
          working?” He asked frustrated. This cat is familiar. You know this
          man. What are we doing here, how do we get back?! And WHERE ARE MY
          MEMORIES?
