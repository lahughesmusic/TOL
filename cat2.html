          He looks at you but only for a moment, then he quickly goes back to
          pawing the ornament. ‘clink’ ‘clink’ ‘clink’ it goes. He seems focused
          and determined. You ask him, why are you making so much noise? To
          which he replies “I am lost. I have lost my human and I have lost my
          memory. I do not know where I am, but I am hungry. I know that
          whenever I hear this sound, food appears, it is but a very vague
          memory, but the instinct is strong. Why is it not working?” This cat
          is familiar. You know this man. As soon as you pet his head, it all
          comes back to you. This is YOUR CAT! What are we doing here, how do we
          get back?! And WHERE ARE MY MEMORIES?
