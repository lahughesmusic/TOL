          It doesnâ€™t take long at all to find the source of the sound. After
          following the noise for only a moment, you come upon the largest most
          beautifully decorated tree you have ever seen. There were ornaments of
          all colors and bows and lights of all shapes and sizes. And at the
          very bottom of the tree sits our noisemaker. A fat cat pawing a low
          hanging ornament.
