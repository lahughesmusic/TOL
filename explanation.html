          The little red bird is standing on the ground now, keeping a cautious
          distance from the cat. His red color is a beautiful contrast to the
          untouched white snow all around him. He looks up at you but then puts
          his head immediately down again as if he was going to say something,
          but couldn’t. ‘What is it’ you urge. He begins, still looking at the
          ground ‘you are in the woods, my friend, but not just any woods. These
          woods get lonely, but when they do, don’t hesitate to reach out and
          touch those around you that care for you and love you. Don’t ever
          think you’re in these woods alone, you may not see any footprints in
          the snow, but don’t make assumptions. I am here, but you don’t see my
          footprints because I fly. Some days, you will wake up in these woods,
          and you won’t know why you’re here or how to get out, but you just
          need to remember to reach out and touch because Whitney, I will always
          be there for you. Now, if we keep walking, I want to show you a
          magical trail, a trail that will take you out of the woods if only for
          a moment. Grab your loved one’s hand and enjoy the journey, don’t
          forget to touch”
