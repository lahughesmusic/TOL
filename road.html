          Little red bird is leading the way. You are not far behind, he has
          been good about keeping a sustainable pace. Odd thing though, now that
          you are not touching the tree, the loneliness is sinking back in. The
          further the bird flies from you, the more isolated you feel. Nothing
          feels right. You have lost your connection to everything, and the only
          way to get it back, seems to be to touch a living thing. You are in
          the middle of a thought, you’re thinking about how you will not be
          leaving this experience a good yelp review when you hear a tiny little
          clinking. The clinking was akin to a pin drop in a quiet room, you
          would have never heard it if even a small wind had been making its way
          through, but ‘clink clink clink’ you hear. The bird is a little ways
          ahead of you but when he notices that you’ve slowed he (in frustrated
          movements only a bird could make) flies back towards you to see what
          the hold up is. ‘I hear something’ you say. ‘ I want to see what it
          is, maybe it is another person lost like me’ the bird settles on a
          tree branch at about shoulder height to you. He hangs his head and
          lets out a sigh, ‘well let’s get on with it then’
